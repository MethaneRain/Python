Repo of a ```class``` example of working with my various GFS quarter degree project scripts.

<h3>Goal</h3>

Take unchanging map design and data plotting code bundle and make a quick automated 72-hour forecast map archive script. 

<h3>Method/Reasoning</h3>

Learn to use ```classes``` more in my projects and get a more <em><a href="" target="_blank">practical</a></em> and <em><a href="" target="_blank">efficient</a></em> approach. 

I am trying to work more from a design, test, execute, etc. (Agile?) flow as much as I can gather, learning on the fly.
