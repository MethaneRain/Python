<h2>Reop of a ```class``` example of working with my various GFS quarter degree project.</h2>

<h3>Goal</h3>

Take unchanging map design and data plotted code bundle and make a quick 72-hour forecast map archive script. 

<h3>Method/Reasoning</h3>

Learn to use ```classes``` more in my projects and get a more <em>hands-on</em> approach. 

I am trying to work more from a design, test, execute, etc. (Agile?)
