# Pandas are another flexible and easy to use package that will allow exploration and manipulation of data, as well as an interface into Python for plotting and other usage.

___Pandas work in DataFrames___

<i>Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively called index. <b>Pandas Series is nothing but a column in an excel sheet.</b>

Labels need not be unique but must be a hashable type. <b>The object supports both integer and label-based indexing</b> and provides a host of methods for performing operations involving the index.</i>
