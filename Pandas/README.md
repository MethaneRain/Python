# Pandas are another flexible and easy to use package that will allow exploration and manipulation of data, as well as an interface into Python for plotting and other usage.

___Pandas work in DataFrames___

<i>Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively called index. <b>Pandas Series is nothing but a column in an excel sheet.</b>
Labels need not be unique but must be a hashable type. <p style="text-decoration: underline;">The object supports both integer and label-based indexing.</p> and provides a host of methods for performing operations involving the index.</i>




Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
