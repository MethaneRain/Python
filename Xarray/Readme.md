Xarray is an external package for Python which has great flexibility for working with data arrays.

Since it was designed for working with data, the built-in functions of this package are very powerful if you need to explore and use large chunks of data. It allows the data to now be integrated into Python and thus be manipulated, visualized, and many other tasks!
